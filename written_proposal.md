# Hauptgang — Recipe Tracker for the RevenueCat Shipyard

I am addressing the idea presented by Eitan Bernath.

## Problem and Use Case

There are so many interesting recipes all over the internet, but it's really hard to keep track of them and actually come back to try them. In my own life, I find recipes in books, magazines, websites, and Instagram. Most of the time I just screenshot them, and then I never look at them again. I've talked to a lot of people who do the exact same thing — the problem isn't finding good recipes, it's that there's no easy way to save them properly before you've already moved on.

## Target Audience

I'm targeting both younger, digital-native users and older generations. Both groups have the same issue: they come across way more recipes than they can keep track of. There are already several successful recipe managers out there, like Paprika Recipe Manager, that people happily pay for. But these apps were built for a time when people had a handful of recipes to type in. They haven't caught up with the reality that people are now drowning in recipes from dozens of sources every week.

## How Hauptgang Solves This

Hauptgang uses AI to parse and import recipes from basically any source. You see a recipe on a website, on Instagram, even a photo of a cookbook page — you hit share, and it shows up in your collection, fully structured, in seconds. No typing, no copying ingredients one by one.

This matters because the reason people stop using recipe managers is that entering recipes manually is a pain. If saving a recipe takes more than a few seconds, most people just won't do it. Hauptgang removes that friction entirely.

## Monetization Strategy

People are already paying for recipe managers that require way more effort to use. Since Hauptgang saves them a ton of time, I think there's a clear value proposition at an attractive price point.

The plan is to have a free tier with a limited number of imports, so users can try it and see how fast and accurate the imports are. Once they hit the limit, they pay to keep going. By that point they've already seen what it can do, so the upgrade feels like a no-brainer.
