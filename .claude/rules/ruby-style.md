# Code Style

This project uses **rubocop-rails-omakase** for Ruby styling, which provides standardized Rails conventions from Basecamp/37signals. Follow these standards when writing code.

## CI Requirements

Run `bin/ci` before committing. All checks (style, security audits, tests) must pass before merging.
